Project 3, the goal is to create a security game, where you have to try and guess a code and the program will give you hints and responses as you guess incorrectly. All that has been completed so far is the basic layout of the GUI. Still needed is to add functionality to the buttons, and program game responses. I would also like to change the dimensions and fonts on the buttons, as well as possibly add some color. I look forward on working on this code more in the coming week

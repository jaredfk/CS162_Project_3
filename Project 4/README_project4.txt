A set of data that could be important to someone is the sizes of different
plants being measured for growth in an experiment. One thing you could do with this
data is search it for the biggest or smallest plants, or the plants with the most growth 
over a set period. This data could be found in a code by entering all of the data into a dictionary,
with each plant assigned to a corresponding number. You could then fetch this data from the 
dictionary and use a min() and max() function to give you the biggest and smallest number.
if looking for growth over a set period of time you could enter two dictionaries
and subtract the corresponding values to give the difference, this number would then be put
into a new list that can be compared for value.

I am having some issues getting pytests to work, so they are not included in this assignment. 
If possible could I send you some pytest once I am able to figure it out?
